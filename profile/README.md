# Welcome to Dotnet IO logger extension project

## Introduction

As dotnet developers we face a lot of challenges every day. One of them is debugging IO operations. 

This process can be time consuming (because some libs hide implementation) and it would be nice to have some tool which can provide a way how to logs and analyze IO operations in debug mode. 

That's a reson why we are here!

With love from dotnet developers to dotnet developers!
